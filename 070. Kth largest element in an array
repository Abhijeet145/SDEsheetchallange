Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.

Efficient Approach:
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> pq;//min heap
        for(auto x:nums){
            pq.push(x);
            if(pq.size()>k) pq.pop();
        }
        return pq.top();
    }
};

//to remember
Use min heap to store k elements and whenever number of elements in heap becomes larger than k we pop an element
