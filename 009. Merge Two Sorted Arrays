Ninja has been given two sorted integer arrays/lists ‘ARR1’ and ‘ARR2’ of size ‘M’ and ‘N’.
Ninja has to merge these sorted arrays/lists into ‘ARR1’ as one sorted array. You may have
to assume that ‘ARR1’ has a size equal to ‘M’ + ‘N’ such that ‘ARR1’ has enough space to add 
all the elements of ‘ARR2’ in ‘ARR1’.

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
vector<int> ninjaAndSortedArrays(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int m, int n)
{
    for(int i=m;i<m+n;i++) // merging the elements of the array
    arr1[i]=arr2[i-m];
    
    sort(arr1.begin(),arr1.end()); // sorting the array
	
    return arr1;
}
