You are given a Singly Linked List of integers and a reference to the node to be deleted.
Every node of the Linked List has a unique value written on it. Your task is to delete
that node from the linked list.

class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val = node->next->val;
        ListNode* temp = node->next;
        node->next = node->next->next;
        delete temp;
    }
};

// to remember
Copy the value of next node into current and then delete the next node.
