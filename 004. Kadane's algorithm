You are given an array (ARR) of length N, consisting of integers. You have to
find the sum of the subarray (including empty subarray) having maximum sum 
among all subarrays.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans=INT_MIN;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            sum+=nums[i];
            ans = max(ans,sum);
            if(sum<0)
                sum=0;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
//to remember
we try to add numbers to our current sum and keep updating the result and 
if at any point we see that current sum is -ve we can easily see that adding
numbers to a already -ve number is never going to give us the maximum value
So we start a new sum from 0.
