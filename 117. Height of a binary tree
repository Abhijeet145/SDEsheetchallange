Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL)
        return 0;
        return max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right)) + 1;
    }
};

// It is just a simple recursive solution where we get the maximum of right and left subtrees
// and add 1 to it to get the total maximum height or depth of the tree
