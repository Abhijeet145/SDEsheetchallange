You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int min_so_far = 1e6;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++)
        {
            min_so_far = min(prices[i],min_so_far);
            profit = max(profit,prices[i]-min_so_far);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};

// simple implementation just see the solution
